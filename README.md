# Codes Introduction

The codes contain three folders that are described as follows. This page also contains the main mauscript titled Buidlings-To-Grid Integration Framework. 

# BtG-Codes (User-Interactive)

This repository contains the required MATLAB codes for the research paper titled Buildings-to-Grid Integration Framework.

The simulations for the proposed Buildings to Grid Integration is performed to compare the results with the decoupled grid Model Predictive Control (MPC) results where two different types of building HVAC control inputs are fed to the grid MPC. For more details please refer to the research paper mentioned above. The README file in that folder instructs the user to the usability of the codes. 

# MAT Files

This repository includes all the .mat files for the solution of the optimization problems for all scenarios for all casefiles. 

# MAT Files

This repository includes all the MATLAB .fig files for the plots of the solutions for all scenarios for all casefiles.
