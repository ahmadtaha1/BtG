# Interactive BtG Codes

This repository contains the required MATLAB codes for the following research papers:

1. A.F.Taha, N.Gatsis, B. Dong, A.Pipri, Z.Li, "Buildings-to-Grid Integration Framework" submitted to IEEE Trans. on Smart Grids, submitted March 2017.

2. Z.Li, A.Pipri, B.Dong, N.Gatsis, A.F.Taha, N.Yu, "Modelling, Simulation and Control of Smart and Connected Communities" submitted to International Building Performance Simulation Association , Building Simulation Conference 2017.

If you are using any part of this material in your research, please cite the above references.

The user is requested to install CPLEX Optimization Toolbox to run these codes.

## Steps to execute the user interactive codes

0. Download the .mat files from this Dropbox folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/by8baj32w2ikll5/AAB8_zqzVZUPZyMK6dYD92hoa?dl=0

These are the files that contain the data for the casefiles. The user can download these files in zip folder and then extract it to this directory of these codes. The codes will not run without the above four .mat files provided via the Dropbox link. 

1. Run the m file named 'User_file_to_run.m'.

2. Please select the case file to be Simulated from the options available.

3. Select the scenario which is to be simulated, for details please refer to the paper [1] mentioned above. The BtG-GMPC scenario is the third one.
